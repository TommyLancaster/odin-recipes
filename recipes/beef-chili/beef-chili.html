        <h1>Lazy Hazy Beef Chili</h1>

        <img src="../../img/beef-chili.webp" alt="beef chili">

        <p>Despite all the shortcuts, this lazy hazy beef chili is tremendously delicious. For a little-to-no work beef chili, this lacks for nothing. Chunky salsa does all the chopping for you, and the hazy IPA adds a subtle bitterness, a little acidity, and a certain something nobody will be able to pick out. As everybody knows, the most fun part of cheating is getting away with it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2lbs ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tbs chili powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground chipotle</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>12 ounces hazy IPA beer</li>
            <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 can diced fire-roasted tomatoes w/ green chilies</li>
            <li>2 jars extra chunk salsa</li>
            <li>2 cans pinto beans, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Toppings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add beef to dry cold pot, turn heat to high</li>
            <li>When beef sizzles, break into small pieces. Cook until
            longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add chili powder, chipotle, black pepper, salt, and
            cinnamon to the pot. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then pour
            in beer. </li>
            <li>Stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the
            pot as you do. Let mixture boil until liquid is reduced by
            about half, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and
            jarred salsa. Stir in; return mixture to a simmer. </li>
            <li>Stir in beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook,
            stirring occasionally, until chili is thickened and flavor
            is developed to your liking, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Taste, adjust the seasoning. Top with sour cream, green onions, Cheddar cheese, and cilantro as desired.</li>
        </ol>

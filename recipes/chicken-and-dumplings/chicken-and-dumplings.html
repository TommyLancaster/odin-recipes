        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This Instant Pot chicken and dumplings recipe provides the
        richness of a long-simmered chicken stew without the fuss of
        using a whole chicken. This compromise — using boneless skinless
        chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast — gave me the
        richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for.
        It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather
        than an oven.</p> 
        
        <p>Chicken and dumplings is a soup-like dish that consists of chicken, a thick broth, and dumplings made out of biscuit dough. The iconic comfort food is filling, made with cheap ingredients, and deliciously cozy.</p>

        </ul>

        </ol>

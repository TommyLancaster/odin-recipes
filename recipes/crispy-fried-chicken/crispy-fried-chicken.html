        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Seasonings</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
            <li>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the
            chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in
            buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour
            mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated
            chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour
            coating to become a paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat.
            Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover
            the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the
            cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy.
            Drain the chicken on paper towels</li>
        </ol>
